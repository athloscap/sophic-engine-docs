title: 'Authentication'

The Sophic Engine API uses `Bearer` tokens for authentication. Our Bearer tokens are
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and are issued using the `client_credentials` OAuth2 flow. You
will be provided with a client ID and client secret when you onboard with Sophic.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.engine.usesophic.com/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

Once your obtain a token, you should provide it in subsequent requests via [HTTP Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

By default, our tokens are short-lived (expire after 15 minutes) and should be refreshed
as needed. To renew your JWTs you should go through the `client_credentials` flow again
(i.e calling the `POST /auth/token` endpoint). Our `client_credentials` flow does not
support refresh tokens.

Remember that your **client secret is a secret.** Do not share it with others or
expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). The `client_credentials` flow is
a machine-to-machine flow so your client-side code should obtain a JWT by going through
your backend first.
