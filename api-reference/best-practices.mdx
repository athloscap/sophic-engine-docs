description: A list of best practices for a stable integration.
---

The following is a non-exhaustive list of recommended best practices for a stable integration:

- Treat all Sophic-generated IDs as opaque strings (do not parse them); support up to 255 characters
- Store IDs in a case-sensitive way; do not normalize case or trim whitespace
- Do not rely on JSON property order in requests or responses
- Ignore unfamiliar response fields for forward compatibility
- Treat enums as open-ended: implement a safe fallback for unknown enum values
- Do not parse human-readable error messages; implement logic using error codes only
- Implement a fallback behavior for unknown error codes (e.g., treat as non-retryable unless explicitly marked retryable)
- Set conservative timeouts and retry safely for network failures
- Validate inputs client-side where feasible, but do not rely on client-side validation alone
- Log request IDs returned by Sophic to speed up support and incident resolution and, if possible,
provide a `Client-Request-Id` header in your requests
- Pin your integration to a specific Api-Version and plan upgrades during the published support window
- Monitor for deprecation signals (e.g., `Api-Version-Sunset` header) and alert on them
